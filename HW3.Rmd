# 2 Curves:

### What is the aggregate daily demand curve for gasoline?
### From $0 to `r round(a_low,2)`: P = `r round(b_tot,7)`Q + `r round(a_tot,2)`, From `r round(a_low,2)` to infity:  P = `r round(b_high,7)`Q + `r round(a_high,2)`  
### What is the supply curve for gasoline?
### P = `r round(s_slope,8)`Q + 0
### What is the “benefit” to consumers under the status quo?
### `r round(social_tot,1)`
### What is the “benefit” to producers under the status quo?
### `r round(producer,1)`
### What is the environmental cost under the status quo?
### `r round(env_cost,1)`

# 3 Consumer Benefit:

### How is the current consumer benefit divided between “high” and “low” income consumers?
### "high" income consumers attain `r round(social_high,1)` and "Low" income consumers  attain `r round(social_low,1)`, which means the "high" income consumers

# 4 Derive the optimal gas tax: `$``r round(t,2)`:

### a) How will this tax affect the amount of gasoline produced and consumed?
### The amount of gasoline produced and consumed will move from `r round(demand_alt(3), 0)` down to `r round (demand_alt(3.45), 0)` 
### b) How will this tax affect the amount of gasoline produced and consumed?
### The price of gas for consumers is $3.45 inclusive of the tax, meanwhile, suppliers get paid $3 per gallon.
### c) How will this tax affect the overall welfare of “high” income consumers?
### Total welfare will go from `r round(social_high,0)` down to
