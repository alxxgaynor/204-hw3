# 1) Marginal Externality Cost of Gasoline

**The marginal externality cost per gallon of gasoline is `$``r round(t, 2)` and found by $51 per metric ton/2204.62 lbs per metric ton * 19.6 lbs per gallon gas.**

# 2) Curves

```{r, echo=FALSE, results=TRUE}
plot_e
```

### What is the aggregate daily demand curve for gasoline?
**From $0 to `r round(a_low,2)`: P = `r round(b_tot,7)`Q + `r round(a_tot,2)`, from `r round(a_low,2)` to infity:  P = `r round(b_high,7)`Q + `r round(a_high,2)`** 

### What is the supply curve for gasoline?
**P = `r round(s_slope,8)`Q + 0**

### What is the “benefit” to consumers under the status quo?
**`r round(social_tot,1)`**

### What is the “benefit” to producers under the status quo?
**`r round(producer,1)`**

### What is the environmental cost under the status quo?
**`r round(env_cost,1)`**

# 3) Consumer Benefit

### How is the current consumer benefit divided between “high” and “low” income consumers?
**"High" income consumers attain `$``r round(social_high,0)` of benefit and "low" income consumers  attain `$``r round(social_low,0)` of benefit for a total of `$``r round(social_tot,0)`. "High" income consumers receive `r round(high_percentage,0)` percent of the total benefit.**

# 4) Derive the Optimal Gas Tax: `$``r round(t,2)` 

### a) How will this tax affect the amount of gasoline produced and consumed?
**The amount of gasoline produced and consumed will move from `r round(demand_alt(3), 0)`, down to `r round (demand_alt(3.45), 0)`.**

### b) How will this tax affect the price of gasoline?
**The price of gas for consumers is $3.45 inclusive of the tax.**
**Meanwhile, suppliers get paid $3 per gallon.**

### c) How will this tax affect the overall welfare of “high” income consumers?
**Welfare for "high" income consumers will go from `r round(social_high,0)` down to `r round(wellfare_high(51),0)`, or a loss of `r round(net_high,0)`.**

### d) How will this tax affect the overall welfare of “low” income consumers?
**Before the tax, total welfare for "low" income consumers `r round(total_welfare_low,0)` was the total benefit `r round(social_low,0)` for "low" income people - the environmental damage burden that fell on them `r round(tax_revenue(51),0)`. Considering that no environemtnal damage occurs after the tax, the new total benefit for "low" income people is `r round(wellfare_low(51),0)`, or a gain of `r round(-net_low,0)`.**

### e) How will this tax affect gas producers?
**Supplier surplus for producers will go from `r round(producer,0)` down to `r round(producer_surplus(51),0)`, or a loss of `r round(net_producer,0)`.**

### f) How will this tax affect total environmental damage?
**At this tax rate there is no environmental damage accounted for with a social cost of carbon of $51.**

### g) How will this tax affect total tax revenue generated?
**Instead of $0 in tax, this will generate `r round(tax_revenue(51),0)`.**

# 5) Redistributing Gas Tax Revenue to Consumers

```{r, echo=FALSE, results=TRUE}
table_scc
```

### a) Overall welfare of “high” income consumers:
**As SCC increases from $51 to $150, a pre-distribution gas tax would have a negative impact on "high" income consumers, decreasing their consumer benefit from $2,792,512.00 to $2,408,666.00. And via post-distribution, "high" income consumers will only be negatively impacted slightly, decreasing their consumer benefit from $2,996,776.00 to $2,962,004.00.**

### b) Overall welfare of “low” income consumers:
**As SCC increases from $51 to $150, a pre-distribution gas tax would have a significant negative impact on "low" income consumers, decreasing their consumer benefit from $512,498.30 to $408,766.90. And via post-distribution, "low" income consumers will greatly benefit, increasing their consumer benefit from $847,274.00 to $1,315,650.90.**

### c) Overall welfare of gas producers:
**As SCC increases from $51 to $150, a gas tax would have a negative impact on gas producers. Producer surplus would decrease from $831,295.30 to $705,194.30.**

# 6) New Demand From New Electric Car Technology

### a) What is total gas consumption?
**`r round(e_gas_tot,0)`**

### b) What is the total environmental externality?
**At a SCC of $51, the tax rate is $0.45, multiplied by the total gas consumption = `r round(e_tax_revenue,0)`.**

### c) What value of the gasoline tax makes the total environmental damage the same as the electric car technology?
**"the same as the electric car technology" ?must? mean (environmental value per gallon saved: $0.45 if the SCC is $51)x(gallons saved by some rich people switching to electric) = `r round(e_car_env_value,0)`. In order to generate the same amount via a tax on the remaining gallons of gas consumed, you would divide the amount by the miles still driven and get `r round(equal_gas_tax,2)`.**
